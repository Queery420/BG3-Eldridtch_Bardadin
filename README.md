# BG3-Eldridtch_Bardadin
a markdown guide for a particularly powerful build in BG3 that I created myself

## Introduction
Bardadin is a tank and single-target melee build that uses Bard's full spell slot progression for extra daily uses of `Divine Smite`.

A typical Bardadin build involves 2 levels into Paladin to pick up `Divine Smite`, then Fighter for `Action Surge`, then College of Swords Bard for 20 `Flourishes` a day and all the spell slots your `Divine Smite` could ever want. This variation trades out levels 7 and 8 in Bard for two levels in Eldritch Knight, which provides access to `Shield` and `Expeditious Retreat` for extreme survivability and mobility, even maintaining the second feat. Furthermore, this build focuses on critical hit damage out put for `Divine Smite` rather than 2-Handed melee damage, allowing another party member to use `Balduran's Giantslayer`.

## Build Theory
### Divine Smite
Paladin's `Divine Smite` is a class feature which consumes a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target of your melee attack. It has the unique feature to be applied after a melee hit as well as not using a spell slot on a miss from manual activation, so you'll always get damage out of it unlike something like `Sleep` or `Command` which can be resisted. `Divine Smite` can also be upcast, allowing you to deal extra damage with higher level spell slots. `Divine Smite` deal 2d8 Radiant damage at level 1 and 1d8 per level of upcast, as follows:
 - Level 1: 2d8 (2 - 12; mean 9)
 - Level 2: 3d8 (3 - 24; mean 13.5)
 - Level 3: 4d8 (4 - 32; mean 18)
 - Level 4: 5d8 (5 - 40; mean 22.5)
 - Level 5: 5d8 (5 - 40; mean 22.5)
 - Level 6: 5d8 (5 - 40; mean 22.5)
 
Critical Hits double the damage of `Divine Smite` as well as the rest of the attack, so disciplined usage of level 4, 5 and 6 spell slots have a mean of 45 extra radiant damage in a range of 10 to 80 per spell slot--up to 8 times per day (mean of 360 damage). There are of course methods of restoring spell slots or gaining extras, so this can be improved even further.

### Notes on Multiclass Spellcasting in 5e
When a character has two classes that each feature `Spellcasting` (not Warlock, which has `Pact Magic`), their levels opperate independently for `Spells Known` for each class, and collectively for `Spell Slots` which are shared among all a character's classes.
 - For example:
   - A Paladin 2 has two 1st level `Spell Slots`, and learns five 1st level Paladin spells.
   - When taking her next level in Bard (Paladin 2/Bard 1), she gains four 1st level Bard spells, and one 1st level spell slot for having two levels of `Spellcasting`.
   - When taking her next level in Bard (Paladin 2/Bard 2), she gains one 1st level Bard spell, and one 2nd level spell slot for having three levels of `Spellcasting`. If she chooses to swap a spell this level, she only has access to 1st level Bard spells because she is a second level Bard. She can notably upcast `Divine Smite`, `Healing Word`, and `Command`.
This means the more a character multiclasses with spell casting, the broader but shallower their pool of spells is, and the more reliant they are on upcasting.
 - In the `Jack of All Trades` achievement run, a character never gains spells above 1st level, but gains `Spell Slots` up to 3rd level.
 - This advantages spells like `Magic Missile`, which benefit from upcasting significantly.

There are a few different ways `Spellcasting` is distributed for different classes.
 - Bards, Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, and Wizards have "Full Progression", or they gain spells and `Spell Slots` every level.
 - Paladins and Rangers are considered "Half Progression" because they only advance their `Spellcasting` on even levels.
   - They do gain half a level every level, so when you have a Paladin 1/Ranger 1, they gain `Spellcasting`.
 - Arcane Trickster Rogues and Eldritch Knight Fighters are "Third Progression" because they gain a level of `Spellcasting` every three levels, though they get their first two as levels 3 and 4.

## Build Details
### Background
 - Wood Elf and Half Wood Elf are both great for the extra mobility, but play whatever you like.
 - While this build especially shines in melee, it still has consistent output at range with 4 attacks per round.
 - I picked BACKGROUND for my background, but play whatever works best for you. Just keep in mind it's hard to sneak in heavy armor.

### Attributes
`STR 10 | DEX 16 | CON 9* | INT 10 | WIS 12 | CHA 17`
 - n.b. CON is minimized because I am at end game and have an item that sets it.
 - For earlier game, you may want `10|16|14|8|8|17` (swap STR and WIS as you wish).
 - +1 to CHA from an event
 
### Levels

#### 1 - Paladin 1 (+1)
The initial level should be Paladin for its extra Weapons and Armours. The proficiency bonus to `WIS` and `CHA` mean you stay in control of your character more often than not when fighting casters.
 - Take `Oath of Vengeance`. It's fine if you break your `Oath`; just become an Oathbreaker.
 - I picked `Athletics` and `Religion` for my skills. `Athletics` helps in melee with pushing and resisting various maneauvers, but the second one is up to you. Make sure you have at least one conversational skill (`Deception`, `Intimidation`, `Persuasion`).

#### 2 - Paladin 2 (+1)
This is where the magic happens (because you get `Spellcasting`, but also because you also get `Divine Smite`).
 - You gain `Divine Smite`, which is the class feature that outputs the most single-target damage in BG3. It turns your sword into a damage hose.
   - Only use it on Crits or to finish off a target. Do not use it to just add more damage, especially in the early game.
 - Take `Defence` for your `Fighting Style` to add `+1 AC`. You'll get `Dueling` later, and you won't use the other two.
 - You probably will never use any of these spells, but I took:
   - `Command`, `Compelled Duel`, `Bless`, `Healing Touch`, and `Thunderous Smite`
 
#### 3 - Paladin 2 / Bard 1 (+1)
